# MySOM
Project repository for MySom, a method of producing SOMs from high dimensiomnal spectroscopic data.

Mechanics
---------
The MySom module is inherits the mechanics of MiniSom (https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom) and includes methods for intensity normalisation of input spectra and consistent SOM output plots.

Usage
-----
For full description of the MySom module and usage, please see published works:
